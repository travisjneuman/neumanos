      content: `NeumanOS exists because the tools that are supposed to help us stay organized have quietly become another source of chaos.

Most people now live across a stack of subscriptions and tabs: one app for planning, another for ideas, another for tracking work, another for personal logistics, plus a handful of dashboards at the office. Each one promises clarity. Together, they fracture attention, duplicate effort, and leave your information scattered across systems you don't really control.

On top of that, many of those tools feel unfinished: new features layered over old problems, workflows that never quite get refined, and products that change direction faster than you can build trust in them. The result is a life and career that are important and complex, being managed by a patchwork of tools that are mostly convenient for the vendors who sell them.

NeumanOS is being built from the opposite starting point.

Instead of chasing surface features, almost all of the work so far has gone into an enduring foundation: how information is stored, how it is kept private, how risk is handled, and how the system should behave before it grows. The goal is not to impress with a long feature list, but to earn the right to hold someone's real commitments, notes, and decisions.

A few core principles define that foundation:

• Local-first mindset – Your information should live with you first, not be locked away behind someone else's subscription or infrastructure.

• Ownership and respect – Your thoughts, plans, and records are not fuel for engagement metrics or growth strategies. They are treated as personal property, not product.

• Honest communication – The platform is described as it truly is: early, foundation-heavy, and far from complete. No marketing fiction.

• Calm by design – No artificial urgency, attention traps, or manipulative flows. The tool should quietly support your focus instead of competing with it.

• Built for many kinds of lives – The same core should feel natural whether you are running a household, a team, a business, or all three at once.

NeumanOS is a long-term effort to prove that an organizing system can be principled, stable, and genuinely respectful of the people who rely on it. It is not a reaction against any single workplace or product, but against the broader pattern of subscription bloat and half-finished tools that demand trust without earning it.

For anyone who is tired of feeling spread thin across tools—and tired of renting access to their own information—NeumanOS is being shaped as a place where everything important can live together, on your terms.`,

      subtitle: 'From the Founder',
      content: `My name is Travis J. Neuman, and NeumanOS started as a personal line in the sand about how our tools should treat us.

I've spent my career in information technology and operations. I've supported a multi-location hospitality group as an IT manager and senior systems administrator. I currently work as a technical project manager in managed services for a global industrial technology environment. I've looked after servers, networks, point-of-sale systems, cloud services, monitoring platforms, and the many tools that keep businesses running.

I genuinely enjoyed that work and still do. I've been fortunate to work with teams and organizations I respect. NeumanOS is not a protest against any employer—past or present. It is a response to something larger: the way we, as individuals and professionals, are increasingly bound to sprawling subscription stacks and unfinished products, both inside and outside the office.

Over the years, I've also run a homelab, built personal websites, and experimented with almost every category of "productivity" tool you can imagine. Some were excellent in specific areas. Very few felt like they were engineered and ethically grounded to be a long-term home for the things that actually matter in a person's life.

So instead of looking for another app, I started building a platform from the ground up, and I chose to treat it with the same seriousness as infrastructure that businesses depend on.

That's why the early work on NeumanOS has focused on:

• Defining a local-first approach so people aren't forced to give up control of their information.

• Writing down privacy boundaries and risk assumptions instead of hiding them.

• Setting clear standards for honesty in how the platform is described versus what it can actually do.

• Holding the code and the product to the expectation that it should be safe to rely on for real responsibilities, not just side projects.

I use this platform myself. My own projects, routines, and planning live on the same foundation that NeumanOS is built on. That means I feel its rough edges first and benefit from its improvements like any other user would. It also keeps me grounded: if a decision wouldn't be acceptable for my own life, it doesn't belong in the product.

What I stand for with NeumanOS is simple:

• Tools that hold our lives together should be designed with respect, not manipulation.

• Our information should not be hostage to subscriptions and shifting business models.

• Foundations should be built carefully, even if that means progress looks slower from the outside.

NeumanOS is the ongoing expression of those beliefs in code, design, and practice.`,

      content: `NeumanOS is a response to two quiet problems: tool overload and shallow craftsmanship.

We juggle multiple apps and subscriptions just to keep a normal life and career on track. Each one tries to solve a slice of the puzzle, but together they scatter our attention and leave our information stored on systems we don't really control.

This platform is being built from the foundation up, not as a feature checklist. The work so far has been about local-first thinking, clear privacy boundaries, honest communication, and calm design—so that when people choose to trust it with their work and lives, that trust is earned.

NeumanOS is for anyone who wants a single, principled place to organize their world without feeling like they're renting access to their own data.`,

      content: `I'm Travis J. Neuman, an IT professional who has spent years supporting real businesses, real infrastructure, and real people.

I've seen how much we rely on software to hold our responsibilities together, and how often that software feels fragmented, subscription-heavy, and half-finished. I've also enjoyed working with organizations that do important work, which is why this project isn't aimed at any one employer. It is aimed at the pattern that traps all of us in tool sprawl.

NeumanOS is my decision to build something different. I treat it like critical infrastructure: local-first by design, explicit about privacy and risk, and held to a higher bar of honesty in how it's described and used.

It's the platform I want for myself—and I'm building it for anyone who's tired of compromising on how their tools treat them.`,
